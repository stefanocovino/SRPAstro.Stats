# Swift Reduction Package

Background
The Swift Reduction Package (hereafter SRP) is a packet of command line tools to solve problems (e.g. basic reduction and analysis tasks of optical/NIR astronomical data, quick cosmological computations, units conversions, etc.) often met in astronomical research activities.

SRP was originally developed in the context of the Swift follow-up activities of the Milan GRB team at the INAF/Brera Astronomical Observatory. The package is designed to be an aid to any researcher to drive further observation of a followed-up GRB counterpart and “swift” can therefore be read simply as “rapid”, “agile”, etc.
 
 This subpackage if the SRP suite is devoted to statistical tools of common use.
